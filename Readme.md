# computed-style

Create an object representing the computed style of a DOM element.  

**Note:** computed-style does not attempt to fix miscalculated properties due to browser bugs. 
Doing so would be too inefficient to be useful. Itâ€™s just a low level shim for `getComputedStyle()`.


## Example

```javascript
var style = require('computed-style')
style(document.body) // => {width:'500px', ...}
```
