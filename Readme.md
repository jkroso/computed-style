# computed-style

Create an object representing the computed style of a DOM element.  
Note: it does not attempt to fix in miscalculated properties due to browser bugs. Doing so would be too inneficient to be useful. Its just a low level shim for getComputedStyle

## Example

```javascript
var style = require('computed-style')
style(document.body) // => {width:'500px', ...}
```
